{"pageProps":{"myCase":{"business":"Irie Kitchen","image":"/Client logo16.png","slug":"irie-kitchen","problem":"Skyward Digital understands the importance of a strong online presence for local businesses, particularly for restaurants like Irie Kitchen. That's why we were excited to work with a local restaurant that was struggling to drive online orders and reservations.","solution":"We began by creating a comprehensive digital marketing strategy that included a new website, social media management, and targeted advertising campaigns. We also helped them set up and optimise their online ordering and reservation systems. Our team created a user-friendly website with a clear call to action and made sure that the website is mobile responsive. In addition to the website, we also helped the restaurant with their social media presence by creating engaging content and managing their social media accounts. We also ran targeted advertising campaigns to reach a larger audience and drive more reservations and online orders.","results":"The results were impressive. Within the first month of working with us, the restaurant saw a 200% increase in footfalls and online bookings. Additionally, their social media following grew exponentially, and they saw an increase in foot traffic to their restaurant. At Skyward Digital, we take pride in understanding the unique needs of our clients and tailoring our approach to their specific goals. Our team is dedicated to delivering results and is always available to answer the restaurant's questions and provide guidance and support. They were impressed with our ability to deliver the results they needed for their business."}},"__N_SSG":true}
