{"pageProps":{"myCase":{"business":"Mother Mary Welfare Center","image":"/client logo66.png","slug":"mother-mary-welfare-center","problem":"Skyward Digital was approached by Mother Mary Welfare Center, a non-profit organisation that specialises in providing education and resources for individuals with disabilities. The organisation had been in business for several years, but was struggling to increase its online presence and reach new audiences. They had a limited budget for advertising and had not seen much success with their previous ad agency. The main problem was that the non-profit was not effectively reaching its target audience and website traffic was low. They needed a cost-effective solution to improve their online presence and raise awareness about their mission.","solution":"To solve this problem, Skyward Digital proposed a comprehensive Google Ads campaign that targeted specific keywords related to the non profit's mission and specific geographic location. We also suggested using a combination of text and display ads, as well as remarketing campaigns to retarget potential leads who had already visited the non profit's website. In addition to the Google Ads campaign, we also suggested improvements to the non-profit's website to make it more appealing to their target audience. This included implementing donation forms and landing pages to increase the conversion rate.","results":"The result of the campaign was a significant increase in website traffic and engagement for the non-profit. Their website's visibility improved, and they were able to reach their target audience effectively. They also received positive feedback from supporters who found the organization through the ads. Skyward Digital provided regular reports on the performance of the campaign and made adjustments as needed. The non-profit was able to reach their target audience effectively and make the most out of their limited budget. Online donations increased by 30% and there was an increase in supporter engagement."}},"__N_SSG":true}
