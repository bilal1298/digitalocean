          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "White Label Website Design refers to the creation of custom websites for clients, which are then branded as if they were created by the agency itself. In other words, the agency can take credit for the website design and development work, without actually having to handle the technical aspects of it. This approach allows agencies to expand their services and increase their revenue without incurring the costs and time required to build and maintain an in-house design and development team. The white label website design process involves using a variety of platforms and technologies such as HTML, WordPress, PHP, React, Laravel, Shopify, Wix, Magento, and WooCommerce. This ensures that the website design can be customized to meet the specific needs and preferences of each individual client. The agency works with a white label partner to understand the client's goals and preferences, and then provides a design that aligns with their brand and target audience. The partner then handles the technical aspects of website design and development, delivering a high-quality, custom website that is both visually appealing and functional.",

                <>
                  White Label Website Design refers to the creation of custom websites for clients, which are then branded as if they were created by the agency itself. In other words, the agency can
                  take credit for the website design and development work, without actually having to handle the technical aspects of it. This approach allows agencies to expand their services and
                  increase their revenue without incurring the costs and time required to build and maintain an in-house design and development team.
                  <br />
                  <br /> The white label website design process involves using a variety of platforms and technologies such as HTML, WordPress, PHP, React, Laravel, Shopify, Wix, Magento, and
                  WooCommerce. This ensures that the website design can be customized to meet the specific needs and preferences of each individual client. The agency works with a white label partner
                  to understand the client's goals and preferences, and then provides a design that aligns with their brand and target audience. The partner then handles the technical aspects of
                  website design and development, delivering a high-quality, custom website that is both visually appealing and functional.
